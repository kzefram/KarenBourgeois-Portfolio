                    <p>I'm an ex-Holistic Health Coach turned Full-stack and Software Quality Assurance Tester.</p><br/>
                    <p>I have been homeschooling my daughter part-time since she was three, and that brings me to how I became interested in coding and software testing. She had approached me with a passing interest in coding. At the time, I didn't know much about it at all and needed to learn the basics.</p><br/>
                    <p>I read many books, and within a month, I was online in classes and watched YouTube. I went with Mike Dane for most of my classes and MIT for the Scratch training; I thought it would be fun. As I was learning the HTML and CSS to teach her, and eventually a few more, I learned about animations and making things happen. "OOHH! That's cool! What else can I learn?" I then moved on to New Brunswick Community College for Manual Testing and UNB for a Full-Stack program. </p><br/>
                    <p>My plans are extensive and challenging. Drop me a <a class="Contac-link" href="#Contact-Me">line</a> to learn more about me and my goals.</p><br><br><br>

                                There are 3 options: underage, legal age, and still going. C#</p>
